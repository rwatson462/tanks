# Todo

> This is a big list, perhaps not fully documented here, but roughly in order
> of when they'll be done. Items higher up are likely to be implemented sooner.

* Add "camera" so we can zoom in/out and have maps that are not the same
   size as the screen.
* Randomly generated maps
* Better destructable blocks - blocks have health so take multiple hits to
   destroy.
* Add player health
* Show player health
* Add enemies
* Count score
* Show remaining enemies on the map
* Add summary screen when map finishes
* Add menu system
* Record high scores
* Upgrade Missile weapon so it homes in on target location
* Add Land mine weapon type
* Add method for unlocking weapons as the game progresses.  Something like
   power-ups on the floow to collect that give you access to a new weapon
